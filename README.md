# COVID-19-and-myocardial-injury
original data and R code 
The association of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with myocardial injury is not well known. 
This study aimed to explore the association between them by using the Mendelian randomization (MR) method.
We first obtained genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary data concerning myocardial injury and COVID-19 from public accesses. 
We then selected single nucleotide polymorphisms linked to susceptibility and COVID-19 severity as tool variables to examine the causal correlation of COVID-19 with myocardial injury using inverse-variance weighting (IVW) as the primary approach. 
Finally, the reliability of the results was evaluated by performing sensitivity analyses.
